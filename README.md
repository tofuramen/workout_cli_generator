# workout_cli_generator

Very simple cli workout generator. Copy the code or git pull. Only module you'll need is random, which is part of the standard library. 
This is a terminal application. There will be 3-4 questions asked to determine what kind of workout you'll get. The application isn't case sensitive as 
everything will be automatically defaulted to lowercase. Do not add any additional spaces before or after your choices.

Example:

"What level of difficulty do you want for you workouts? Groovy or Wildin?"

Will be asked first no matter what. Groovy is a light workout and wildin is a more heavy intense workout. 

"What kind of workout would you like? Compound or split? compound"

If you want to do a select split between different body types you can type in split and if you want to do a more compound workout such as upper, lower or
fullbody, type in compound in your terminal. If you choose compound it'll ask you one more question:

"Do you want to do upperbody, lowerbody or fullbody?"

Type in one of the three choices. Again no additional spaces, quotes or anything.

If you choose split it'll ask you what your primary and secondary muscle group is. 

"What is the primary muscle group? Chest, Back, Legs or Shoulders?"

"What is the secondary muscle group? Triceps, Biceps, Shoulders or core?"
